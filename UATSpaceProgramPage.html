<!--Space Vacation to the Galactic Star Casino-->
<!--Have you ever wanted an out of this world Experience?
        Have you ever want to hang out and play among the stars (not the human kind)?
        Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your journey to the stars. On our journey to the Galactic Star Casino, we will be passing through history:
        the history of space exploration where the first man in space has journeyed, where the first man to step foot on the moon went through,
        where some of you are making your own history by making your first trip into space, the final frontier.
         Please enjoy the sight of not only space but also the sights and sounds of the Galactic Star Casino as slot machines are spinning and people are screaming
        with joy and excitement of their wins. While you are here, make sure you hit our feature game The Galactic Star Craps Game where you can win big and be the star of the casino.-->
